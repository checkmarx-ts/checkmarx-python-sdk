  title: Access Management Service
  description: |
    The Access Management APIs are used for managing access to specific resources in your tenant account.

    An admin user can use the POST `Create an assignment` API to create an "assignment". An "assignment" specifies one or more "entities" (user, group or OAuth Client) and grants them permission to access specific "resources" (tenant, application or project). You can also specify "roles" that designate the permissions for this assignment. If not specified, then each user is has the permissions specified in his "base role".

    Each role comprises a series of permissions that specify the precise actions that he is authorized to take. The system comes with a set of preconfigured (out-of-the-box) "System Roles". In addition you can create custom roles based on the granular permissions that are available in the system.

    ## Phase 2 Features

    This API includes Phase 2 endpoints that provide enhanced functionality:

    - **Bulk Operations**: Create multiple assignments, manage multiple roles efficiently
    - **Role Management**: Advanced role creation, updates, and deletion capabilities
    - **Base Role Management**: Comprehensive base role assignment and management
    - **Internal Entities Management**: Fast access to internal AM storage for improved performance
    - **Entity Resources**: Enhanced reporting of entities and their assigned resources
    - **Advanced Entity Management**: Detailed effective permissions retrieval and management

    ### Phase 2 Endpoint Categories

    - **Bulk Assignment Operations**: `/assignments`, `/assignments/roles`
    - **Role Management**: `/roles`, `/roles/{id}`, `/permissions`
    - **Base Role Operations**: `/base-roles/{id}/*`
    - **Internal Entities Management**: `/internal/users`, `/internal/groups`, `/internal/clients`
    - **Entity Resources**: `/users-resources`, `/clients-resources`, `/groups-resources`
    - **Advanced Entity Management**: `/my-groups`, `/effective-permissions`
